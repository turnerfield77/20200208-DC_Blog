    HTML Tags we might use:
    - <img /> for the logo
    - <button> for the follow button
    - <a>, <ul> and <li> for the toolbars
    - <hr> for divider line 
    CSS we might use:
    - text-align
    - margin: 0 auto;
    - float: left or display: inline-block

    <header> - Will contain logo with DigitalCrafts text, as well as the about/follow/all posts list
    <body> - 2 div's for title and date/follow button
        <main> - <p> tags for each paragraph
        <hr> divide main from footer
        <footer> - contain subscribe/previous/next

    Issues so far:
        - I'll need to wrap the header in div element so it isn't included in the body's text alignment
        - In the header, I need to align the unordered list to the right
        - Padding needs to be corrected for the main paragraphs

                    I'm writing a paragraph long enough to hopefully get a few lines in. I need to test this CSS and make sure that the text is working as expected.
                    I'll have to position it to the right but I really don't understand the position property in CSS. It kind of makes sense, but I feel that way about
                    the rest of CSS. Seems impossible so far.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This is another paragraph just to test limits. My favorite game of all time is Super Smash Bros melee. I've played it competitively for many years now,
                    and it just never gets old. I play daily as a stress relief and I couldn't love it more still. If I could make a living from it, I would.

                    I do hope that this bootcamp pans out and I can actually start writing some real software. I don't actually want to go to Dev, but if I must, I will.
                    I just don't want to be stuck on tickets forever. And maybe Chad's t-shirt business will actually take off. I'd like to write the site for that and 
                    ride out that money gravy train.
